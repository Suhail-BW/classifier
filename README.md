# cricket ball classifier
I made this after completing lesson no. 2 from fastai course. I have used transfer learning to make a classifier that can classify between test cricket ball, white cricket ball and tennis ball.
* Developed a classifier that distinguishes between different types of cricket balls
* Scraped the data from internet by using duckduckgo search api
* Implemented transfer learning by using resnet-18 architecture and deployed model using flask framework
